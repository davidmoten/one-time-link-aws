<h2>About <b>One Time Link</b></h2>

<p>If you have a secret (text) that you want to communicate to someone then 
submit your text to One Time Link and it will give you a link to send to them (by secure means).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The link will display the secret once and only once.</li>
<li>The secret is encrypted using a key that is present in
the generated link. Only the encrypted secret is present in backend
storage and the backend is not aware of the key used to encrypt the secret.</li>
<li>The encrypted secret is deleted from backend storage on viewing</li>
<li>Unviewed encrypted secrets are deleted from backend storage within 12 hours of expiry</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you communicate that link to someone via a <b>secure means</b> (like Signal, WhatsApp). If 
you send the link to someone using a non-secure means like email 
then you are exposed to a man-in-the-middle attack in that someone else can intercept the 
link, view it, then create another link to forward to the receiving party. Neither the sender nor the receiving 
part are aware of the leaking of the secret.</p>
 
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paste your secret into the given textbox</li>
<li>Select how long the link will remain valid for</li>
<li>Click Encrypt</li>
<li>Copy the link and send it to the receiver via a secure means</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h4>What to do if the receiver cannot view the secret?</h4>
<p>If the receiver of the link cannot view the secret then it is possible 
that the secret has been compromised by a third party. This is really only 
possible if the transport mechanism you use has been compromised (like non-TLS email). In this 
situation the original secret should be changed and resent (perhaps by 
another transport method!).</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Version: ${project.version}</p>

<p>The critical part of this implementation is coming up with an easy cheap way of 
guaranteeing exactly-once delivery. Yes you could achieve this using a database
that supports transactions but there is another much simpler and cheaper way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em"><i>create one new FIFO SQS queue per message which is disposed of on message view</i>.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda is a great cheap solution to run the backend serverless but occasionally
a user may encounter a ten second delay while a new backend server is provisioned 
("cold start"). Not a big deal every now and then.</p>
