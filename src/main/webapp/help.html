<h2>One Time Link Help</h2>
<p>If you have a secret (text) that you want to communicate to someone then 
submit your text to One Time Link and it will give you a link that you can give to that person. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The link will display the secret once and only once.</li>
<li>The secret is encrypted using a key that is present in
the generated link. Only the encrypted secret is present in backend
storage and the backend is not aware of the key used to encrypt the secret.</li>
<li>The encrypted secret is deleted from backend storage on viewing</li>
<li>Unviewed encrypted secrets are deleted from backend storage within 12 hours of expiry</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you communicate that link to someone via a **secure means** (like Signal, WhatsApp). If 
you send the link to someone using a non-secure means like email 
then you are exposed to a man-in-the-middle attack in that someone else can intercept the 
link, view it, then create another link to forward to the receiving party. Neither the sender nor the receiving 
part are aware of the leaking of the secret.</p>

 
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paste your secret into the given textbox</li>
<li>Select how long the link will remain valid for</li>
<li>Click Encrypt</li>
<li>Copy the link and send it to the receiver</li>
</ul>
