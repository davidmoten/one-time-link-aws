<h2>OneTimeLink Help</h2>
<p>If you have a secret (text) that you want to communicate to someone then 
submit your text to OneTimeLink and it will give you a link that you can give to that person. 
That link will display the secret to that person once and only once.</p>

<p>Make sure you communicate that link to someone via a **secure means** (like Signal, WhatsApp). If 
you send the link to someone using a non-secure means like email 
then you are exposed to a man-in-the-middle attack in that someone else can intercept the 
link, view it, then create another link to forward to the receiving party. Neither the sender nor the receiving 
part are aware of the leaking of the secret.</p>

 
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paste your secret into the given textbox</li>
<li>Select how long the link will remain valid for</li>
<li>Click Encrypt</li>
<li>Copy the link and send it to the receiver</li>
</ul>
